@inproceedings{BoLeSc03,
    abstract = {The transposition principle, also called Tellegen's principle, is a set of transformation rules for linear programs. Yet, though well known, it is not used systematically, and few practical implementations rely on it. In this article, we propose explicit transposed versions of polynomial multiplication and division but also new faster algorithms for multipoint evaluation, interpolation and their transposes. We report on their implementation in Shoup's {NTL} C++ library.},
